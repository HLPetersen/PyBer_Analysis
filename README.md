# <b> PyBer Analysis </b>

## <u>Overview of Analysis</u>
PyBer is a a Python-based ridesharing app company. There are two datasets that this analysis is based on, city data and ride data. City data contains the number of drivers per city and the city type for 120 cities that use the app. The ride data provides the city, date, fare, and ride id from 2,375 ride instances.  

### Purpose of Analysis   
This is an exploratory analysis of the number of drivers and rides for PyBer based on the city type. The analysis will provide information to support and guide business decicions at the company based on the data. 

## <u>Analysis and Challenges</u>
The original data sets, city data and ride data, have 120 rows and 2,375 rows respectively. The first goal was to merge the data to be able to extract information about the number of drivers, city type, fare, and number of rides.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When the data was merged, the driver count was duplicated for every ride that was taken in the city. Driver count had to come from the original city data to be accurate.
